# Willing people

Hi! I've been doing a lot of talks, consultancy sessions, workshops lately.
However, I can't say 'yes' to every invite!

So here is a bunch of companies and people you might want to ask instead. Either because I've worked with them in the past, or simply because I've met them and I think they're great people, and I know they are willing to deliver amazing content.

:warning: Rules of the game:

1. 💑 These are just referrals, not guarantees. No liability shizzles here, I'm just trying to help in matchmaking.
2. 📞 If you are contacted people based on this list, please let them know how you found them :).
3. 🤷‍♂️ This list is far from complete, I've met too many great people for that in the last few years!
4. 📝 If you want to add yourself to the list, feel free to open a PR. But only if we either collaborated in the past, or met IRL.

Thanks!
